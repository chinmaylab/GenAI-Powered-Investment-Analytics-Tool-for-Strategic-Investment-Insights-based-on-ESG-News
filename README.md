# Unlocking Market Insights: A Predictive Framework for CSR/ESG News Impact on Investment Worthiness

This project develops a predictive framework using advanced machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to examine the impact of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) and Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) news on the investment worthiness of companies, as measured by abnormal stock returns. The research utilizes a comprehensive dataset, including financial data from CRSP and Compustat, market factors from the Fama-French model, and CSR/ESG news and ratings from Refinitivâ€™s LSEG platform, covering a broad spectrum of firms and events.

The empirical results indicate that CSR/ESG news has a limited but significant influence on abnormal stock returns, with varying effects depending on the nature and timing of the news. Specifically, environmental and human capital-related news tends to impact stock prices immediately, while corporate governance-related news shows a more delayed yet long lasting effect. 

This research contributes to the literature by bridging the gap in understanding the dynamic and temporal aspects of CSR/ESG news on financial performance. The findings offer practical implications for improving investment decision-making and corporate governance through data-driven approaches, underscoring the importance of sustainability in financial markets.
